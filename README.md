This system uses machine learning to detect meteor objects in spectrogram images, utilizing several methods for enhanced accuracy. These methods include YOLO11m, MeteorNet, a hybrid model combining MobileNet_v3 with Random Forest, and a Fusion model that integrates the results of YOLO11m and MeteorNet. 

The best results were achieved by the Fusion model, which leverages the strengths of the other methods for superior performance. The report outlines the potential for future improvements and broader applications of the system in atmospheric research.
